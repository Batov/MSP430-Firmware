Necessary includes in DriverLib by TI
Used Code Composer Studio
Firmware for msp430f5510
Manage PWM for 4 power engines 
i2c on p3.0 & p3.1
Use i2c-tools

command line: i2cset -y 2 0x48 0x0 0XXYY w

Bytes format:
0x`XX`YY` - HEX(2 bytes)

YY:
First and second bits set mode of engine
00 - Neutral
01 - Back
10 - Forward
11 - Block (Not for all engines)
Last bits is number of engine

XX:
Second bytes set power of engine
0x64 = 100%
0xa = 10%
(there is uncertainty)

 E.g. : 0x4405 = First Back 68%

 Software Reset =  i2cset -y 2 0x48 0x0 0xffff w
